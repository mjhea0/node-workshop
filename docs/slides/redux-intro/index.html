## Objectives

By the end of this talk you should be able to:

1. Describe Redux along with the "Three Principles" of Redux
1. Describe the difference between actions, reducers, and stores as well as how each relates to state
1. Add Redux to a React app created with the Create React App boilerplate
1. Set up a basic React + Redux app
1. Add Redux to the existing React Jobs App

---

## Why Redux?

http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Motivation.html

As your React app grows, state generally becomes more and more [spread out](images/state-issues.jpg) amongst different class-based components. This is messy. Plus, state is tightly coupled with the view logic.

--

Redux helps to mitigate those issues by managing state in a single place outside of React, promoting-

1. A single source of truth
1. Seperation of concerns

## What is Redux? (part 1)

[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) is a tool based on the [Flux](https://medium.com/hacking-and-gonzo/flux-vs-mvc-design-patterns-57b28c0f71b7) pattern for managing application state.

--

### Principles

1. **Single source of truth**: The *state* of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single *store*.
1. **State is read-only**: The only way to change the state is to emit an *action*, an object describing what happened.
1. **Changes are made with pure functions**: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure *reducers*.

[Source](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.md)

---

## What is Redux? (part 2)

### Definitions

1. **State**: an object, probably nested
1. **Actions**: describes intended change of state, declarative, think of an action as just a set of instructions used by Redux to update state
1. **Reducers**: pure function, which takes the previous state and action as arguments, returns updated state, should be the only thing updating state
1. **Store**: where state lives

[Source](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/)

### `Action -> Reducer -> State -> View`

---

## Project Setup

Create Project:

```sh
$ create-react-app hello-world-react-redux
$ cd hello-world-react-redux
$ npm start
```

Remove everything in "src" except the *index.js*, and then install Redux:

```sh
$ npm install redux@3.6.0 react-redux@5.0.3 --save
```

From the project root, add the following directories and files to "src":

```sh
$ cd src && mkdir actions components reducers && touch store.js && cd ..
```

Check the structure:

```sh
$ tree -I node_modules
```

---

## Create a Store

*index.js*:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { createStore } from 'redux';

const store = createStore();

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

--

You should see the following error in your browser - `Error: Expected the reducer to be a function`. Why?

--

*`createStore()` takes a reducer*

---

## Define a Reducer

Update *index.js*:

```javascript
const reducer = (state=0, action) => { return state; }
const store = createStore(reducer);
console.log(store.getState());
```

--

What's happening?

--

1. We defined a reducer, which takes the previous state (`0`) and an action (which we have yet to define) and returns a new state (`0`).
1. The reducer is then passed as an argument into `createStore`, setting the initial state of the app.

--

Now we can add an action to update state...

---

## Add an Action

First, let's update the reducer:

```javascript
const reducer = (state=0, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') return ++state;
  return state;
}
```

--

So, when the reducer gets an `INCREMENT` action, it should return `state` + `1`.

--

Add the action:

```javascript
const incrementAction = { type: 'INCREMENT' }
```

--

Test it out:

```javascript
console.log('before -> ', store.getState());
store.dispatch(incrementAction);
console.log('after -> ', store.getState());
```

--

The `dispatch()` applies the action to the store so that the state is changed.

--

**YOUR TURN!** Add a `DECREMENT` action...

---

## Refactor (part 1)

First, move the store to *stores.js*:

```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';

import reducer from  './reducers';

const store = createStore(reducer);

export default store;
```

--

Second, add an *index.js* file to "reducers":

```javascript
function reducer(state=0, action) {
  if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') return ++state;
  return state;
}

export default reducer;
```

--

To test, remove the `store` and `reducer` definitions from *index.js* and add in the import - `import store from './store'`.

---

## Refactor (part 2)

Next, an *index.js* file to "actions":

```javascript
const incrementAction = { type: 'INCREMENT' };

export default incrementAction;
```

--

Remove the action from *index.js* and add the import - `import incrementAction from './actions'`. Test it out!

--

**YOUR TURN!**

1. Update your code to handle the `DECREMENT` action.
1. Review the code with your neighbor, adding in comments as necessary.

---

## Update the View (part 1)

Remove:

```javascript
console.log('before -> ', store.getState());
store.dispatch(incrementAction);
console.log('after -> ', store.getState());
```

--

Update `App`:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <br/>
      <p>Value: <span>{  store.getState() }</span></p>
      <button
        className="btn btn-success"
        onClick={ () => store.dispatch(incrementAction) }
      >+</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

--

**YOUR TURN!** You've seen this all before. Review it with your neighbor.

---

## Update the View (part 2)

Update the `render` method:

```javascript
const render = () => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <App />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  )
}

store.subscribe(render);
render();
```
--

What's happening?

--

1. We wrapped `ReactDOM.render()` in a function aptly named `render`
1. `render()` is added as the store via `subscribe` - which listens for changes any time an action is dispatched


---

## Add a Child Component (part 1)

Within "components", add a new file called *Child.jsx*:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const Child = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Functional Child Component</h2>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Child
```

--

Add the import to *index.js*.

```javascript
import Child from './components/Child.jsx'
```

--

Add `<Child/>` to the `render` function, just below the button.

---

## Add a Child Component (part 2)

Add `props` to `<Child/>`:

```javascript
<Child
  onIncrement={ () => store.dispatch(incrementAction) }
/>
```

--

Add the button to `Child`:

```javascript
<button
  className="btn btn-primary"
  onClick={ props.onIncrement }
>+</button>
```

--

**YOUR TURN!** You've seen this all before. Review it with your neighbor.

---

## Next Steps

That's it! What's next?

1. Make it look nice. Add Bootstrap.
1. Grab the final [code](https://github.com/mjhea0/node-workshop/tree/master/w2/exercises/hello-world-react-redux).
1. Turn to the [node-jobs-react-class](https://github.com/mjhea0/node-workshop/tree/master/w2/exercises/node-jobs-react-class) project. Add Redux and add jobs to a new store. Make sure to handle the AJAX request correctly.
