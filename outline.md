End goal: Build a full-stack application with Node and Express where the user can authenticate via the Twitter and then data from the Twitter API is displayed to the user.

## Pre Work

### Dependencies

Make sure you have Node version 6 or greater and NPM version 3 or greater::

```sh
$ node -v

$ npm -v

```

If you need to update, you can download both Node and NPM [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/).

### NodeSchool

Work through the following [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/) workshops:

1. [javascripting](https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting)
1. [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)

Make sure you complete javascripting and at least the first five learnyounode exercises. Create a new repository for each and push your code to GitHub. Try your best to work on this together. Send me the link once complete. Also, if you get stuck, please mark down what you're having problems with.

Happy to meet at least once before the first workshop starts to help you through the pre-work.
