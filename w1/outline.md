# Outline

v1.0.0

### End Goal

Build a full-stack application with Node and Express where the user can authenticate via [Gnip](https://gnip.com/). Once authenticated, the user is then displayed some nice charts and graphs populated with data from the Gnip API.

### Example Code

Make sure to create a new directory on your machine called "node-workshop" to house all of your projects for these workshops. Each individual assignment should be placed within that directory. Make sure to add a git repo to each directory.
